## Docker-compose

### Spin up Keep with docker-compose latest images
The easiest way to start keep is is with docker-compose:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.yml | docker-compose -f - up
```

The docker-compose.yml contains two services:
- keep-backend - a fastapi service that as the API server.
- keep-frontend - a nextjs app that serves as Keep UI interface.

### Docker-compose dev images
You can use `docker-compose.dev.yml` to start Keep in a development mode.

First, clone the Keep repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Next, run
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml - up
```


## Kubernetes
Keep can be installed via Helm Chart.

First, clone Keep:
```
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Next, install using:
```
helm install -f chart/keep/values.yaml keep chart/keep/
```

Notice for it to work locally, you'll need this port forwarding:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000
```

To learn more about Keep's helm chart, see https://github.com/keephq/keep/blob/main/chart/keep/README.md

## VSCode
You can run Keep from your VSCode (after cloning the repo) by adding this configurations to your `launch.json`:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Keep Backend",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "keep/cli/cli.py",
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "justMyCode": false,
        "args": ["--json", "api","--multi-tenant"],
        "env": {"PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION": "1"}
      },
      {
        "name": "Keep Frontend",
        "type": "node-terminal",
        "request": "launch",
        "command": "npm run dev",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/keep-ui",
      }
    ]
  }
```
